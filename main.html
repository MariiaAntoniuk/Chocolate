  	   The basis of chocolate is cocoa - a type of evergreen tree from the Theobroma genus.<br>
  	   From Latin, the word "theobroma" is translated as "food of the gods" (theos - god, broma - food).<br> Chocolate trees are very heat-loving because <br>
  	   they only grow near the equator in humid tropical forests where there is a lot of sun and rainfall.<br>
  	   Flowers appear directly on the trunk of the tree, and after pollination by insects - fruits.<br>
  	   As soon as the fruits are ripe, they are cut,<br>
  	   opened and the white slimy seeds are removed, which will later become cocoa beans.
  	</h5>
  	<h5>
  		Thousands of years ago, beans were dried in the sun, where they acquired a brownish-red color.<br>
  		 Oddly enough, today this stage takes place in the same way.<br>
  		 After drying, the cocoa beans were ground and added to water.<br>
  		 It was the first version as a bitter fortifying drink with foam.<br>
  		 It was not very similar to what we are used to drinking today from the look of yakoo.<br>
  		 In the Middle Ages in Europe, the powder was considered a cure for indigestion, coughs and colds.<br>
  		 Then sugar cane or honey, spices (chili pepper, cinnamon, etc.)<br>
  		 were added to it, ahead of the trend for today's popular spicy cocoa in fashionable coffee shops.
